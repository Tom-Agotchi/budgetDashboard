# budgetDashboard
 
Useful monthly budget tool using D3 and Node. This was hastily hacked together. At the time I made this I didn't know about React, so I used D3. There's a lot of ugliness and shamefully hard coded stuff, but it worked nicely when I needed it. I intended to clean things up, split into multiple files, take JSON input, and make the animation to and from bar chart and pie chart work correctly, but alas, I most likely never will.
